	<h2>Steps:</h2>
	<p>
		Here are the brief steps to make Penne alla Vodka:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>In a blender or food processor, puree the can of whole peeled tomatoes until smooth. Set aside.</li>
		<li>In a large skillet or saucepan, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat. Add the pancetta (or bacon) and cook until crispy. Remove the pancetta from the pan and set aside on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
		<li>In the same pan with the pancetta drippings, add the finely diced onion and sauté until translucent and softened.</li>
		<li>Add the minced garlic, crushed red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper to the pan. Sauté for another minute until the garlic becomes fragrant.</li>
		<li>Pour in the tomato puree and tomato paste. Stir well to combine with the onion and garlic mixture.</li>
		<li>Add the torn basil leaves and a handful of chopped parsley to the sauce. Stir and let it simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the penne or rigatoni pasta according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
		<li>Back to the sauce, pour in the vodka and stir. Allow the sauce to simmer for an additional 5 minutes, allowing the alcohol to cook off.</li>
		<li>Reduce the heat to low and stir in the heavy cream. Simmer for a few minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.</li>
		<li>Drain the cooked pasta and add it to the sauce. Toss the pasta in the sauce until well coated.</li>
		<li>Serve the Penne alla Vodka in individual bowls or plates. Top with the crispy pancetta and freshly grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
